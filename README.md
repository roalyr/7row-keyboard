- Numeric layout has extra pop-up keyboards with extra math symbols.
- All layouts share the same bottom rows for unification.

## Notes
Make sure you adjust the keyboard vertical size, key lable font size for proper rendering.
Also you might need to adjust the spacebar vertical size since relative vertical units in jbak2
might not be recognized properly by the time I write this.
